OOP object oritented programming


an object has two important aspects what it has and what it does

what it has is attributes

whats it does is methods (methods are funtions associated to an object)

for example in a hotel, we need multiple modules like waiter, chef etc, now these are created as objects

if we want multiple waiters then we create them by creating a blueprint of how to create these objects this blueprint is called class

waiter(class)--> individual waiters like betty(object) and jerry(object)

creating an object in code:
car = CarBlueprint()
car is the object
CarBlueprint is the classname and it should be written in Pascal case meaning first case is capital
parantheses in the end just like defining functions to construct/initiate an object
