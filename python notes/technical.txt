Q10. Shell scripts, Java, programming questions and then managerial rounds

Written Test: Contains 15 MCQ and 2 programming questions.
Programming Question 1: Find the username from given mail. (E.g: abcd@gmail.com, here the word before @ is username . So we have to print abcd)
Programming Question 2: Calculate sum of diagonal of given unsquare matrix E.g: For matrix [[1,2,3],[4,5,6]] output is 6 and for matrix [[1,2],[3,4],[5,6]] output is 5.

Round 2: Technical Round 1
Programming question 1: Sum of pair of numbers from given array which is equivalent to given value : (For E.g: array ( 1,2,3,4,5,6) and value is 6 . so, output is (1,5) gives 6 and (2,4) gives 6. They have checked all the corner cases and also they are checking space and time complexity.
Objective question 1: In a excel, columns are named as A,B,C,...,Z,AA,AB,AC,....,AZ,BA,BB,BC,....,BZ,........ The task is we have to map numbers for that columns . E.g: A is 1 , B is 2 ,.... Z is 26, AA is 27, AB is 28, AC is 29 ,.... AZ is 52 , BA is 53 ...... We have to find the equivalent number for the given column name For E.g: for this AB is equal to 28 and ABA is 729 . We have to derive mathematical formula for it.

Round 2: Technical round 2
1. check whether the word Amazon present in given file.
2. given two file with name and marks. Print the total mark for the person
file 1:
abc,70
def,90
ghi,100

file2:
def, 75
abc, 90

Output:
abc,160
def,165
ghi,100

3.Print the name of file which has volume of more than 1 GB from a directory
4. Print the 5th word of line which is divided by 3 ( printing 5 th word from line number 3,6,9,12,.....)
5. Check given two string is rotated string . (E.g : string1= ABCD , string2= BCDA. rotating string1 by 1 position will give string2. So print Yes)
6.Trouble shooting question.For E.g : Consider the application Facebook , which supports both mobile app and web app. Problem is a person is uploaded a photo in web app . But the photo is not visible in Mobile App. How did you analyze and find the root cause. I have listed the some steps . And interviewer asked what next ? he asked what next until he get all possible ways

Round 3: Managerial Round 1:
Questions are about Amazon Leadership principle and project related questions

Round 4: Manager Round 2:

This also should be Leadership principal . But interviewer asked Technical questions.
1. Gave a program using Stack Datastructure and find the output of it.
2. Shell script . Download a zip file from given website . Upload it to remote server and extract the zip file in remote server. Ensure the file permission and also count the number of file which has extension as *.html and *.css
3.Some project experiences
