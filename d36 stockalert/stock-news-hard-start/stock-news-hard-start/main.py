# When STOCK price increase/decreases by 5% between yesterday and the day before yesterday then print("Get News").
#HINT 1: Get the closing price for yesterday and the day before yesterday.
# Find the positive difference between the two prices. e.g. 40 - 20 = -20, but the positive difference is 20.
#HINT 2: Work out the value of 5% of yerstday's closing stock price.

# response  = requests.get(url=STOCK_ENDPOINT,params=STOCK_PARAMETERS)
# response.raise_for_status()
# yesterday_close_price = float(response.json()["Time Series (Daily)"]["2021-10-22"]["4. close"])
# db_yesterday_close_price = float(response.json()["Time Series (Daily)"]["2021-10-21"]["4. close"])
# #above values are hardcoded
# if abs(yesterday_close_price - db_yesterday_close_price)>20:
#     print("get news")
# print(0.05*(yesterday_close_price))
yesterday = datetime.now() - timedelta(2)
yesterday_date = datetime.strftime(yesterday, '%Y-%m-%d')
db_yesterday = datetime.now() - timedelta(2)
db_yesterday_date = datetime.strftime(yesterday, '%Y-%m-%d')
## STEP 2: Use https://newsapi.org/docs/endpoints/everything
# Instead of printing ("Get News"), actually fetch the first 3 articles for the COMPANY_NAME. 
#HINT 1: Think about using the Python Slice Operator



## STEP 3: Use twilio.com/docs/sms/quickstart/python
# Send a separate message with each article's title and description to your phone number. 
#HINT 1: Consider using a List Comprehension.



#Optional: Format the SMS message like this:
