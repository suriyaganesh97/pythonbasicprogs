# When STOCK price increase/decreases by 5% between yesterday and the day before yesterday then print("Get News").
# HINT 1: Get the closing price for yesterday and the day before yesterday.
# Find the positive difference between the two prices. e.g. 40 - 20 = -20, but the positive difference is 20.
# HINT 2: Work out the value of 5% of yerstday's closing stock price.

# response = requests.get(url=STOCK_ENDPOINT, params=STOCK_PARAMETERS)
# response.raise_for_status()
# data = response.json()["Time Series (Daily)"]
# data_list = [value for (key, value) in data.items()]
# yesterday_close_price = float(data_list[0]["4. close"])
# db_yesterday_close_price = float(data_list[1]["4. close"])
#
# print(abs(yesterday_close_price - db_yesterday_close_price))
# if abs(yesterday_close_price - db_yesterday_close_price) > 20:
#     print("get news")
# print(0.05 * yesterday_close_price)

## STEP 2: Use https://newsapi.org/docs/endpoints/everything
# Instead of printing ("Get News"), actually fetch the first 3 articles for the COMPANY_NAME. 
# HINT 1: Think about using the Python Slice Operator

formatted_news_data = news_data[0:3]

news_article = [f"headline {data['title']}:{data['description']}" for data in formatted_news_data]
print(news_article)
## STEP 3: Use twilio.com/docs/sms/quickstart/python
# Send a separate message with each article's title and description to your phone number. 
# HINT 1: Consider using a List Comprehension.


# Optional: Format the SMS message like this:
